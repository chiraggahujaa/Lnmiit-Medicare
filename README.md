## Introduction

LNMIIT Medicare is designed to streamline the health record management process using the concept of UHID (Unique Health Identifier). It addresses the inefficiencies in traditional health record systems and provides a user-friendly interface for admins, faculty, and students to manage health records efficiently.

## Problem and Motivation

The motivation behind LNMIIT Medicare came from personal experiences encountering inefficient health record management systems. Common issues included the lack of a standardized procedure for managing patient information, make-up requests, and the absence of an identification process for forged medical certificates.
